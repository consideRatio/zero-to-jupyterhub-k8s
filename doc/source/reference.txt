# Configuration Reference

The [JupyterHub Helm chart](https://github.com/jupyterhub/zero-to-jupyterhub-k8s)
is configurable by values in `config.yaml`. This means that you can customize
your JupyterHub deployment in many ways. You can extend user resources, build
off of different Docker images, manage security and authentication, and more.

Below is a description of the fields that are exposed with the JupyterHub helm
chart. For more guided information about some specific things you can do with
modifications to the helm chart, see the [extending jupyterhub]
(extending-jupyterhub.html) and [user environment](user-environment.html) pages.
